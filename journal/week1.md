## Containerize Application (Docker files, Docker Compose)

Built Backend container ran Trivy Vulnerability Scanner for Containers to check for Vulnerabilities.
I think I spent(wasted?) alot of time trying to get zero vulnerabilities

![Unset](../_docs/assets/week1/unset.png)



After that did the same with the front end Built ran Trivy Vulnerability Scanner an pushed to DockerHub.

Did a Andrew Brown and Labeled it 0.2 instead of 0.1

![Frontend](../_docs/assets/week1/frontend.png)

Pushed both images to DockerHub

Checked that Postgres was working from the docker-compose.
![Postgres](../_docs/assets/week1/postgres.png
Checked that I was able to access the Dynamodb from the container I had spun up via the docker-compose.
![DynamoB](../_docs/assets/week1/dynamodb.png)
Here I added the Swagger for notifications.
